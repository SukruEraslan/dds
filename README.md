# Integration of Web Page and Eye Tracking Data Driven Approaches for Automatic AOI Detection

There are different types of web-page segmentation algorithms available in the literature. One group of these algorithms analyses the source code and visual representation of web pages to segment them into their elements whereas another group analyses the eye movements of web users to identify the attractive elements, i.e. areas of interest (AOI). We propose to combine these two approaches to consider both the source code & visual representation of web pages and the eye movements of web users. 

This repository includes the implementation of the proposed approach by using C programming language. It also includes the materials and data used for the evaluation of the approach.

For further details about the proposed approach, please see the following paper:
